# Head Detection Using YOLO Algorithm
The objective is to train a YOLO algorithm to detect multiple heads from as frame.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. TensorFlow
2. Keras

### Download the pre-trained weights for the backend
Download full_yolo_backend.h5 from https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AM2OzK4S4RpT%2DSU&id=5FDEBAB7450CDD92%21121&cid=5FDEBAB7450CDD92

Put it in the root directory.
### Dataset
 Download the dataset and put it in the root directory.

### Training
Run train.py

The weights for the front-end will be saved in the file name "model.h5".

### Testing
Give the path to your image in predict.py

Run predict.py
